<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Let's Encrypt is "a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority." They provide free signed certificates as a trusted certificate authority. This tutorial walks through the process of installing certbot and requesting new certificates and renewing existing ones with Let's Encrypt.</p>

<p>If you are just looking to generate your own quick self-signed certificates, check out my tutorial on <a href="/content/creating-self-signed-ssl-certificates-openssl">creating self-signed SSL certificates with OpenSSL</a>.</p>

<p>Certificates signed by trusted authorities used to be expensive and out of reach for many people. Let's Encrypt has changed the landscape by providing free signed certificates that are <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2018/08/06/trusted-by-all-major-root-programs.html" target="_blank">trusted by all major root programs</a> like Microsoft, Google, Apple, Mozilla, Oracle, and Blackberry. With a certificate from Let's Encrypt, users will not get a warning message when they visit your site telling them you have an untrusted certificate.</p>






<a name="client_options"></a>
<h2>Client options</h2>

<p>There are several Let's Encrypt clients available. There is a Bash shell tool, <a href="https://github.com/srvrco/getssl/tree/APIv2" target="_blank">getssl</a>, but the most recommended client is <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/" target="_blank">Certbot</a>. It is written in Python and makes the process simple. The <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/" target="_blank">full list</a> of client options and libraries are available on the <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank">Let's Encrypt</a> website. There are also libraries for Java, Python, Go, C, C++, and many other languages.</p>

<p>Always check the <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/" target="_blank">official Let's Encrypt documentation</a> for latest instructions and tools. This is just my preferred method of installing and updating certificates with Let's Encrypt. This tutorial focuses on the <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/" target="_blank">Certbot</a> client on Ubuntu, but there are <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/all-instructions" target="_blank">official Certbot installation instructions</a> for just about every platform you can think of if you are using a different system.</p>







<a name="installing_on_ubuntu"></a>
<h2>Installing Certbot on Ubuntu</h2>

<p>The best way to install certbot on Ubuntu is to use the system package manager <strong>apt-get</strong>. You'll need to first add the apt repository and then refresh your package database using the <strong>update</strong> command as demonstrated below. After these commands you should be able to run <strong>certbot</strong> from the command line.</p>

<pre><code>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install certbot
</code></pre>






<a name="getting_new_cert"></a>
<h2>Getting a new certificate</h2>

<p>You can run certbot with no arguments and it will prompt you with a menu. You do not need a web server running in order to get your certificate. If you run it with the <strong>certonly</strong> command and it will prompt you and ask how you want to procede. One of the options available is to  spin up a standalone web server. You can then store the certificate and key and save it for use until whenever you are ready.</p>

<p>I prefer using the certonly method because I want full control over the configurations that use the certificate. I just want the certificate and key files and I don't want certbot to mess with any of my web server configurations.</p>

<pre><code>
# Key and certs will be in /etc/letsencrypt/live
sudo certbot certonly
</code></pre>

<p>Output snippet:</p>

<pre><code>
How would you like to authenticate with the ACME CA?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1: Spin up a temporary webserver (standalone)
2: Place files in webroot directory (webroot)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Select the appropriate number [1-2] then [enter] (press 'c' to cancel):
</code></pre>





<a name="renewing_certificates"></a>
<h2>Renewing certificates</h2>

<pre><code>
# Dry run if you are unsure of what changes will take place
sudo certbot renew --dry-run

# Renew certificates
sudo certbot renew

# Or you can simply run it the same way you did the first time
# It should detect you already have a cert and ask if you want
# to renew it with the same information
sudo certbot certonly
</code></pre>




<a name="conclusion"></a>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Let's Encrypt and the certbot tool have many more options than what is covered here. This was only a simple quick start and a reference for those who just need to get a simple certificate. If you only need a self-signed certificate, check out my tutorial on <a href="/content/creating-self-signed-ssl-certificates-openssl">creating self-signed SSL certificates with OpenSSL</a>.</p>

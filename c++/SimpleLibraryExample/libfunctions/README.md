Creating a custom reusable library
==================================

The src/ dir contains the source files for the library.
The obj/ dir contains the object files 
The lib/ dir contains the shared lib .so and the static lib .a
The include/ dir contains the header files that other programs use when compiling
The example_usage/ dir contains an example of how to compile and link against the shared library.

Set the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to specify custom paths for the .so shared libs.
